# Docker image for QGIS server

## Usage

Expects a `project.qgs` project file and all the files it depends on in the `/etc/qgisserver/`
directory. Either you create another image to add those files or you inject them using
a volume. For example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8380:80 --volume=$PWD/etc/qgisserver:/etc/qgisserver camptocamp/qgis-server
```

With the previous command, you'll get to your server with this URL:
http://localhost:8380/?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

## Tuning

You can use the following variables (`-e` option in `docker run`):

- QGIS_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL: The debug level for the logs (0=max debug, 3=no debug logs)
- PGSERVICEFILE: If you want to change the default of `/etc/qgisserver/pg_service.conf`
- QGIS_PROJECT_FILE: If you want to change the default of `/etc/qgisserver/project.qgs`
- QGIS_CATCH_SEGV: Set to "1" if you want stacktraces in the logs in case of segmentation faults.
- FCGID_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_PROCESS: The number of requests a QGIS server will serve before being restarted by apache
- FCGID_MIN_PROCESSES: The minimum number of fcgi processes to keep (defaults to 1)
- FCGID_MAX_PROCESSES: The maximum number of fcgi processes to keep (defaults to 5)
- FCGID_IO_TIMEOUT: This is the maximum period of time the module will wait while trying to read from or
  write to a FastCGI application (default to 40)
- FCGID_BUSY_TIMEOUT: The maximum time limit for request handling (defaults to 300)
- FCGID_IDLE_TIMEOUT: Application processes which have not handled a request for
  this period of time will be terminated (defaults to 300)
- FILTER_ENV: Filter the environment variables with e.g.:
  `| grep -vi \_SERVICE* | grep -vi \_TCP | grep -vi \_UDP | grep -vi \_PORT` to remove the default
  Kubernetes environment variables (default in an empty string)

Fonts present in the `/etc/qgisserver/fonts` directory will be installed and thus usable by QGIS.

## Running the client

If you want to edit a project file, you can run the client from a Linux machine with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -e DISPLAY=unix${DISPLAY} -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v ${HOME}:${HOME} camptocamp/qgis-server:latest-desktop
```
